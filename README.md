1.App Summary. Provide a brief (5–8 sentence) overview explaining the problem your application solves, who the primary user is, and what your product does.

- Healthy Habits is a parent-guided wellness app designed to help young children build positive daily routines around nutrition, physical activity, and balanced screen time. Many parents struggle to encourage healthy behaviors without daily conflict, and existing tools only address these habits in isolation. Healthy Habits solves this by unifying meal logging, activity tracking, and screen‑time balance into one simple, family-friendly system. The primary users are parents of young children who want support—not stress—as they guide their child’s development. The app allows parents to set goals, track progress, and manage child profiles while receiving age-appropriate examples, gentle reminders, and evidence‑based tips. A kid-friendly dashboard reinforces progress using positive, non‑weight‑focused language. By combining tracking, encouragement, and playful habit-building, Healthy Habits helps families create routines that stick—without shame, anxiety, or pressure.
